Title: The End Of The Computer<br/>
Author: Andre Mikhailovich Solonitsyn<br/>
Excerpt: “I have been between worlds. I have done my best to protect Jerry and Tanya, and keep us hidden. But it was a holding action at best. And I was trying to dissolve... that’s a good word for it... the part of me that is very efficient at night in the jungle. Do you understand?”
	Nikki nodded yes. Anyone who had been around Jeb understood that.
	“This situation has been very painful for me. I’ve had to revisit parts of myself that I think are dark, and... evil. There’s no other word for it. Yet I’m so gifted in these areas.”
	He stopped. Then said, “The time has come for me to end this conflict in my soul. We are in a great battle that will have great consequences. I must fully embrace my skills.”
	This was starting to worry Nikki, and it showed in her eyes.
	Jeb moved closer to her and took her face in his gentle hands. “But not in the same way as before, Nikki. I understand now that you cannot fight for a noble cause with heinous actions.”<br/>
